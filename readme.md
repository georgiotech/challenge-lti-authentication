# Bibliotech Coding Challenge

This challenge was designed to give us a means to assess:

- Your familiarity with ORMs and working with data in a database. (We've chosen Sequelize for the ORM and sqlite3 for the database to simplify the setup)
- Your ability to implement access controls
- If you understand routing in an Express.js application
- Your ability to write integrations with a third party authentication standard
- What you pay attention to when writing your code

Please clone this repository and send through your completed coding challenge using whatever you feel fit. Be sure to include the database file so that we can test your implementation with your data/tables. We'll take a look at it and review it like we would a pull request. Thanks for taking the time.

## The task

Some institutions provide access to a library of books to all of their students. In order for a student to gain access to this library we have to determine their affiliation with an institution. That way, a student from University of the East will automatically be granted access to the books provided by their institution. The way we have chosen to allow this is to perform LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) authentication with 3 specific institutions. Your task is to set up the integration, and where there are gaps in the instructions, come back with a solution.

The requirements are:

1. The following titles should be available to users, based on their institution:

   - University of the East
     - students
       - 9781351831215, 9781317963974
     - academics:
       - 9781351831215, 9781317963974, 9781317671299, 9781317308737, 9781498723305
   - University of the South-West
     - all:
       - 9781351831215, 9781136559860, 9781317963974, 9781351831321, 9781351679725, 9781136547614, 9781498723305
   - University of the North
     - all:
       - 9781136559860, 9781317963974, 9781317671299, 9781351831321, 9781482261806, 9781351679725

    There is a script provided to automatically fill the database with some data, but the `models` are insufficient to limit access per the above requirement. You'll likely want to add additional models, or update the existing ones - your choice.

2. Only students/academics from University of the East, University of the South-West, and University of the North can use the LTI integration to authenticate and they will always authenticate via LTI protocol. Use `models.LITConsumer` to store the `consumerSecret` and `consumerKey` to be used by each institution.

3. Create a test suite which includes code coverage, to unit and integration test the routes youâ€™ve created

4. Expose the following endpoints through [Express](https://expressjs.com/):

    4.1 `POST /users/lti` Authenticates if the LTI information received matches an existing User. Otherwise creates a new user and authenticates provided the institution is recognised.
    4.3 `GET /books` Once authenticated, responds with a JSON object containing a list of Books that the user has access to via their Institution.
    4.4 `GET /books/:isbn` Once authenticated, responds with either a success or failure message depending on if the user can access the requested isbn

5. Any changes to the models or provided data should not break any other code that might depend on the existing table/column names. If you change the models, you could manually update the tables in the database, or you could make use of the scripts provided. Note that running `npm run init-db` will throw an exception if the tables already exist in the database.

6. (Optional) Provide a [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection which performs some basically functionality on the routes you've created.

## What is provided

1. We have provided you a basic structure for a working Express.js application. You should be able to run the server with `npm start` and confirm it works by sending `GET http://localhost:3000/`
2. `npm run init-db` will create a preconfigured sqlite3 database at `./sqlite3.db` with bare-bones tables for:
    - `User` with fields for `name`, `email` - No existing users, but to be used to create a user profile for each new LTI user
    - `Institution` with fields for `name` - Prepoluated with the 3 defined institutions that are allowed to use LTI signins. You do not need to add additional institutions for this challenge
    - `LTIConsumer` with fields for `consumerSecret`, `consumerKey` - empty table to be used for configuring LTI authentication at institutional level.
    - `Book` with fields for `isbn`, `title` - Prepoluated with 10 books that are available. You don't need to add additional books for this challenge.
  
    Assume that `sqlite3.db` mirrors the production database and that any breaking changes to the schema will result in problems.
3. An example request that could come in can be found at `mocks/lti-example.json`

## Out of scope for this challenge

We'd like to help keep you focussed on creating the access controls and LTI authentication. The following are explicitly not required:

1. Any front-end UI. It will suffice to return a response with the data a front-end would require.

## Useful resources

- [LTI Consumer Emulator](https://ltiapps.net/test/tc.php) - can be used to generate the types of HTTP requests that will be received
- [ims-lti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ims-lti) npm package for passport authentication that deals with lti requests

## Things to keep in mind

- Security
- Scalability
- Consistency
- Testing

## Getting started

- You can run the application by typing `npm install` followed by `npm start`. This will start a server on port 3000.
- `npm run init-db` will create a `sqlite3.db` file with some prepopulated data you'll need
